# Handwriting Recognition Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model capable of recognizing and classifying handwritten characters. It is currently an ongoing project, where continuous improvements and additions are being made.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, OpenCV, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, Keras

## Current Progress
- Data Import: The dataset is imported using Pandas. The dataset includes a balanced mix of handwritten characters.
- Data Processing: The data is then concatenated, processed, and prepared for training.
- Model Building: A convolutional neural network (CNN) is used for this classification task, leveraging TensorFlow and Keras.
- Training & Evaluation: The model is trained and evaluated with the dataset.

## Future Work
As this is an ongoing project, future updates will focus on:
- Enhancing the model's accuracy and efficiency.
- Implementing additional data preprocessing techniques.
- Expanding the dataset to include more varied handwriting samples.
- Integrating more advanced neural network architectures.
